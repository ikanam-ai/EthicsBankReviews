### HSE Data Science Hack solution by the ikanam team

The solution is based on a finetuning of BERT-type language models and the use of its embeddings in classification with CatBoost. 

Our results:

The 1st place in leaderboard of metric (ROC_AUC ovr) in both tasks.

The 4th place in the quality of EDA and visualization.


P.S We love Yandex.DataSphere! ^_^
